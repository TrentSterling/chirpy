# Hello World! Welcome to My New DevBlog

Hey, Trent here. This is my first post on my freshly launched DevBlog. I’m transitioning away from WordPress and Surge/Wintersmith and moving everything to GitHub Pages using Jekyll.

---
## Why Jekyll?

I’ve tried static sites before (2017 with NodeJS/Wintersmith), but now Jekyll fits my needs better. It's simple, I can write in Markdown, and GitHub Pages makes deployment painless. The bonus? SSL is built in, unlike Surge. It’s more reliable, and I can commit my Markdown files, and GitHub handles the rest. Much cleaner than the manual build and upload process I was doing before.

## What’s New?

- **Fresh Content & Updates:** I’m bringing over old posts from WordPress and my previous static setup, updating them along the way.
- **Game Dev Focus:** I’ll be diving into topics like Unity, C#, multiplayer, VR optimization, and indie game dev.
- **Clean Slate:** This new setup gives me better control over design and performance, making it easier to maintain and update.

---
## What’s Next?

Here’s what’s coming:

- **VR Performance:** Optimizing for smooth 120Hz gameplay.
- **Multiplayer with FishNet:** Sharing my experiences with cross-platform multiplayer and networking.
- **Tech Deep Dives:** Procedural sound, shaders, and more.
- **Indie Game Dev:** What works, what doesn’t, and what it takes to ship a game as a solo dev.

## Final Thoughts

I've been meaning to update this blog for a very long time. Discord is where I've been sharing my progress with friends and devs. If you're a cool dev-type person, consider joining. We've got a very active group of developers with some seriously cool skill sets. There's a heavy focus on Multiplayer and VR systems, but the Discord also explores other kinds of development too. Whether you're into game dev, networking, or even AI (LLMs+art) and hardware (like Arduino, esp8266/32), we've got a place for you!
